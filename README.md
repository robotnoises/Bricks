## How to use bricks
1. A `brick` represents a side-by-side container. What you put inside a brick is up to you.

2. A `wall` contains bricks. You can put as many bricks is you want in a wall. By default, a wall is just a block-level container and will take up 100% of its container. You can make a wall a wide or narrow as you like.

3. You can put a max of `6` bricks in a row before they start breaking to the next line.

4. A brick will take up a proportinal amount of space in a row based on the fractional width you give it, e.g.

    <!-- Three column layout --->
    <div class="wall">
      <div class="brick col-1-3"></div>
      <div class="brick col-1-3"></div>
      <div class="brick col-1-3"></div>
    </div>

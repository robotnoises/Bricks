# Bricks
A tiny (< 5kb), responsive grid.

## Getting started
1. Install [https://nodejs.org/download/](node), which bundles the Node Package Manager (npm)

2. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/robotnoises/Bricks.git`

3. Navigate to the project root and install the dependencies `npm install`

4. Compile the SASS into CSS `grunt build`

5. The minified CSS will be here: `./dist/bricks.min.css`

## How to use bricks
1. A `brick` represents a side-by-side container. What you put inside a brick is up to you.

2. A `wall` contains bricks. You can put as many bricks in a walkl as you lie. By default, a wall is just a block-level container and will take up 100% of its container. You can make a wall a wide or narrow as you like.

3. You can control the amount of proportional row space a brick occupies by giving it a special `col-*` class like this: `<div class="brick col-1-3"></div>`, which will take up one-third of the space.

3. You can put a max of `6` bricks in a row before they start breaking to the next line, E.g.

```html
<div class="wall">
  <div class="brick col-1-6"></div>
  <div class="brick col-1-6"></div>
  <div class="brick col-1-6"></div>
  <div class="brick col-1-6"></div>
  <div class="brick col-1-6"></div>
  <div class="brick col-1-6"></div>
</div>
```
5. If you want *more* than 6 bricks in a row, just leave-off the `col-*` class. These bricks will display as if they were cells in a table row, which you can add an unlimited amount of.

6. If you want a brick to have a fixed width, you may add that style in a separate class of your choosing. If you want the bricks around it to take up the remaining side-to-side space, leave-off the `col-*` class. E.g.

```html
<div class="wall">
  <div class="brick fixed"> <!-- fixed { width: 300px } -->
    <!-- Content here -->
  </div>
  <div class="brick">
    <!-- Will occupy the remaining space to the right... -->
  </div>
</div>
```

## Available proportions
1/2 `brick col-1-2`

1/3 `brick col-1-3`

1/4 `brick col-1-4`

1/5 `brick col-1-5`

1/6 `brick col-1-6`

2/3 `brick col-2-3`

3/4 `brick col-3-4`

2/5 `brick col-2-5`

3/5 `brick col-3-5`

4/5 `brick col-4-5`
